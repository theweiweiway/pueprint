# ðŸ’© Pueprint ðŸ’©

# Motivation

Flows usually consist of several pages that have an **AppBar** as well as some sort of **Footer** which allows the user to proceed to through the flow. However, these **AppBar** and **Footer** widgets are commonly overlayed _on top_ of each page and are located in parent component, which makes it tedious to tweak these widgets.

This package makes it easy to:

- Declaratively customize each page in a flow without sacrificing styling capabilities
- Support for easily changing progress bars and page indicators through a flow
- Change onTap behaviours on each page
- Render pages based on screen size
- Integrate with any routing libraries (like AutoRoute, VRouter, Routemaster, etc.)
- _coming soon_ Animate **AppBar**s and **Footer**s when changing between pages
- ..and more..

All with minimal boilerplate and code.

In addition to flows, this package provides a simple page blueprint that allows you to easily add **AppBar**s, **Footers**s and **Header**s to pages.
