# Motivation

Flows usually consist of several pages that have an **AppBar**, as well as some sort of **Footer** to allow the user to proceed to the next page.

In addition to flows, there's no easy way to add and customize footers. Even with the `Scaffold` component, there are limitations on how you can customize the footer.
